# BitVivAZ DOTA STATS

I created this project to learn more about using API's and serving data with a Flask application. It was also a good opportunity to learn more about AWS, therefore I decided to host the back end on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.

Currently, the website only supports the resolution of 1920x1080.

### TODO

- Support more resolutions
- Add a search bar to filter through heroes

### Tech Stack

- Flask
- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- SQLite
- Nginx
- Gunicorn
- Amazon Web Services
- GitPages

### Features

- Heroes Pages, Data Page
- SQLite for database
- Python Script that retrieves data from Valve's DOTA API and stores it
- Flask Application which serves the SQLite data to the front-end website
- Front-end that parses all the data and displays it to the user
- Cronjob that runs a python script to update every hour all the data
