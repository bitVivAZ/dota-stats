# BitVivAZ DOTA STATS

I created this project to learn more about using API's and serving data with a Flask application. It was also a good opportunity to learn more about AWS, therefore I decided to host the back end on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.

Currently, the website only supports the resolution of 1920x1080.
